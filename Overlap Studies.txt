BBANDS 

name: 
Bollinger Bands

description: 
The Bollinger Band (BBANDS) study created
by John Bollinger plots upper and lower envelope bands around the
price of the instrument. The width of the bands is based on the
standard deviation of the closing prices from a moving average of
price.

formula:
Middle Band = n-period moving average
Upper Band = Middle Band + ( y * n-period standard deviation)
Lower Band = Middle Band - ( y * n-period standard deviation)

DEMA                 

name:
Double Exponential Moving Average

description: 
The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)
by Patrick Mulloy attempts to offer a smoothed average with less
lag than a straight exponential moving average. The calculation
is more complex than just a moving average of a moving average as
shown in the formula below.

formula:
DEMA = ( 2 * EMA(n)) - (EMA(n) of EMA(n))

EMA                  

name:
Exponential Moving Average

description:
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) represents
an average of prices, but places more weight on recent prices. The
weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the selected
period of the moving average. The shorter the period for the EMA,
the more weight that will be applied to the most recent price.

formula:
EMA = ( P - EMAp ) * K + EMAp
Where:
    P = Price for the current
    period
    EMAp = the Exponential
    moving Average for the previous period
    K = the smoothing constant,
    equal to 2 / (n + 1)
    n = the number of periods
    in a simple moving average roughly approximated by the EMA

KAMA                 
name:
Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average

description:
Developed by Perry Kaufman, Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) is a moving average designed to account for market noise or volatility. KAMA will closely follow prices when the price swings are relatively small and the noise is low. KAMA will adjust when the price swings widen and follow prices from a greater distance. This trend-following indicator can be used to identify the overall trend, time turning points and filter price movem
